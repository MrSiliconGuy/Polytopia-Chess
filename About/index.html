                    Polytopia is a fun, turn-based 4X game created by Midjiwan. Check out Polytopia
                    <a href="http://midjiwan.com/polytopia.html">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Polytopia Chess uses the battle mechanics of Polytopia to create a chess-like game. Instead of a randomly generated terrain,
                    Polytopia Chess pits units to a strategic battle on the familiar 8x8 chessboard.<br />
                    With your army of Xinxi, Imperius or Bardur units, defeat your opponents through tactical battle strategy
                </p>
                <p>This game can be played local multiplayer on a single computer, or even played multiplayer online</p>

                    Left click to place a unit, and right click to remove a unit.<br />
                    You can choose the type of unit, as well as the tribe of the unit using the drop-down menus at the bottom. Different units have
                    different abilities, strengths and weaknesses, just like in the original game<br />
                    You can clear your current board setup using the button at the bottom right. You can also load an example setup with the bottom on
                    the left if you are too lazy to make your own ;)

                    The default setup has two tribes, Xinxi and Imperius. You can change the number of tribes, as well as the tribes order by clicking
                    on the 'Edit' button
                </p>
                <p>The board setup is auto-saved to the browser (as long as cookies are enabled). You can close and reopen your tab at any time.</p>

                    To export a board setup for later use or to start a multiplayer game, click the Export button at the bottom. Copy the resulting
                    code from the text box. This is the code representing your board setup, which you can use to start singleplayer or multiplayer
                    games.

                        and basic knowledge of what the different units are. Further information about individual unit stats can be found
                        <a href="https://polytopia.fandom.com/wiki/Unit_Stats" target="_blank">here</a> and

                    Similar to Polytopia, Polytopia Chess is turn-based. You play by moving your units one by one, then ending your turn. <br />
                    A game starts with the player of the first tribe in the turn order (by default this is Xinxi). Select units by clicking on them,
                    and move, attack enemy units, or perform other actions as desired.

                <p>On your turn, you may perform the following actions in any order:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <u>Move a unit</u>

                                Recover a unit's health by clicking on it and then clicking on the 'recover' button at the bottom. <br />
                                Only available if the unit hasn't moved or attacked yet, and has less than maximum health.

                    (That is, you may either move twice and attack three times, or attack twice or move three times)<br />
                    Once you have reached this limit, you will no longer be able to move or attack with any units
